## Environment Setup   

The Cloud Data Analytics lab is conducted using many components on the IBM cloud. It utilizes dashDB for Analytics to be renamed **Db2 Warehouse on Cloud** as of ~July 18th to persist data and Data Connect (and Lift CLI) to ingest data. These services are available and deployed from Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform. This lab also leverages Cognos Analytics, IBM’s smart data reporting, analytics and visualization service on the cloud.
