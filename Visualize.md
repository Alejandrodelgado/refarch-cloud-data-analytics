# Visualize Your Data

“K Bank” has found that customer loss (churn) is directly related to the customer's satisfaction level. This is kind of obvious, so it would be interesting to see how these churn prediction models could be used to looks at “N Bank” customers and identify who might be at risk of leaving. Since “K Bank” just spent a lot of money to acquire “N Bank”, you do not want to lose any customers if you can help it.

Now that we have the data in one place, we can explore the data and discover how satisfied your customers are, within each Bank and across both Banks. You can also identify which customers are leaving the bank and which ones you should work to retain going forward. You can also create a dashboard to showcase your findings and use it to tell a story of what you discovered and any actions you might want to take base on this analysis for use in your next board meeting.
